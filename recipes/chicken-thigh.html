        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chile-garlic paste</li>
            <li>10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, peanut butter, hoisin sauce, ginger, garlic, 
                and chile paste in a resealable container. Mix well. Stir in cornstarch. 
                Add chicken to marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan or 
                rimmed cookie sheet with a double layer of foil large enough to envelop the 
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Spread chicken evenly over the bottom layer of foil. Top with the marinade, 
                fold the upper layer of foil on top, and wrap to fully cover chicken.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken thighs are no longer pink, about 
                1 hour. Unwrap and sprinkle with cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
